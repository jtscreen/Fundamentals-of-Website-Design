    <p>To be completely honest, there were so many words that I don't think that I comprehended most of it. </p>
    <p>I understood the main point that Chimero was making about how in order to create a successful website, one must know how a successful website is made and follow the formula (or grain) of it.</p>
    <p>Personally, I feel the website was a little long and a little challenging to digest. I personally like multiple pages that break up the text into digestible bites.</p>
    <p>However, I do think the website successfully provided examples of the principles that it was talking about. It provided, images, videos, snippets of code, and an extensive amount of real websites both well-known and not as well known.</p>
    <p>It even breaks down the structure of what Chimero believes to be the grain at one point, but the fact that there are many variations to a successful website, it's hard to have a guaranteed formula for success.</p>
    <p>This website in no way follows the grain, but isn't that interesting in its own right? Maybe try playing with the screen size and something cool will happen...</p>
