    <h3>What is a website anyway?</h3>
    <p>Well...according to the internet, a website is defined as a set of related web pages located under a single domain name, typically produced by a single person or organization.</p>
    <p>But me? In the context of this class, I believe it is a way for people to express or advertise something or someone.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why put things on the internet?</h3>
    <p>We put things on the internet because we feel the need to share what we do with others and it gives people easy access to a much wider range of works.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Will websites someday become obsolete?</h3>
    <p>Websites are now at the point where they will never become obsolete until the machines try to take over the world. But that will never happen &#128517;</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is your relationship with technology?</h3>
    <p>Very unhealthy but in the best of ways. That is all I will say about it...</p>
