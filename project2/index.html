            <p> Fordham University's website (<a href="https://www.fordham.edu" target="_blank">fordham.edu</a>) serves as an institutional portal for Fordham University, providing users with access to various resources, news, and both public and personal information.</p>
            <p>Essentially, it acts as a central hub where individuals can explore what Fordham University has to offer, including potential opportunities, its mission statement, and ways to support the institution through donations.</p>                
            <p>Its target audience encompasses anyone currently or interested in becoming affiliated with Fordham University.</p>

    <!--Content-->
    <h1>--Content--</h1>
    <section id="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>While the content on the site contributes to its purpose, the large volume of information can become overwhelming for users, especially to those who may not have a specific search goal in mind. As a four-years student of the university, I found during my research for this site review that there were sections and features I had never seen before, leaving me unsure of their purpose or function.</p>
            <p>Although the text is legible, the extensive amount of content and numerous sections make it impractical for users to navigate in a single sitting.</p>
            <p>While the site features plenty of images, some are engaging initially but lack relevance to the topics they represent or Fordham itself. However, there are exceptions where images align well with the content, such as those on the covers of linked school newsletters. </p>
            <p>Additionally, while there are short videos dispersed throughout the site, they are often located in specific areas, requiring users to have a clear understanding of where to find them within the site structure.</p>

    <!--UI-->
    <h1>--Visual Appeal|User Interface--</h1>
    <section id="UI">
        <div class="text">
            <p>The website has a form of visual hierarchy, but its message remains somewhat unclear to me. Despite having a section labeled "university news,", the largest text and prominent image are dedicated to a single news article, overshadowing other articles that may get lost in the mix.</p>
            <p>While there's consistency in font and color usage, the layout feels disorganized, with some sections appearing asymmetrical, particularly when viewed on larger screens.</p>
            <p>The overall structure and density of content on the site detract from my engagement and motivation to explore further. In fact, I find the site more suitable for viewing on devices other than a computer due to its layout and presentation.</p>

    <!--UX-->
    <h1>--Interactivity|User Experience--</h1>
    <section id="UX">
        <div class="text">
            <p>The homepage offers navigation options, but its effectiveness depends on the user's familiarity with the site and their intended destination. With 15 sections in the navigation bar, with 9 of them having additional subsections, the array of choices can be overwhelming. </p>
            <p>While the search bar expedites finding specific items, it becomes increasingly challenging with greater specificity and yields more results with broader searches.</p>
            <p> Personally, as a current student, I find the site cumbersome, as I typically only need a handful of sections to access necessary areas. While I acknowledge the relevance of certain sections, I find the collection of promotional content and school news redundant, especially with the countless emails with this information sent out several times a week, no matter how many times you try to unsubscribe.</p>

    <!--Recommendations-->
    <section id="recs">
        <h1>--Recommendations--</h1>
        <p> If given the opportunity to enhance this website, my primary focus would be on de-cluttering the layout for improved user experience.</p>
        <p>For instance, I'd streamline the presentation of articles and questions by omitting unnecessary blurbs, trusting the audience's intelligence to click for further information if desired.</p>
        <p> In terms of navigation, I envision simplifying the primary navigation bar to only display underlined subsections, with a separate top navigation bar on subsequent pages for easier exploration across different sections. For example, under the "About" section, I'd implement clickable links leading to new pages featuring distinct subsections like "Fordham Facts," "Leadership and Administration," and "Fordham's History." Alternatively, I might adopt a structure akin to the Resources tab for better organization.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I'd significantly reduce the amount of text to improve readability, addressing sections that felt overwhelming to navigate.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I'd create a dedicated section labeled "Prospective Students" to centralize essential information, eliminating the need for them to search through various pages.</p>
        <p>While there are numerous other potential enhancements, I believe involving students in the development process or gathering their input would be invaluable in creating user-friendly educational portal sites tailored to their needs and preferences.</p>
