            <p>While Peter Parker is the most well-known Spider-Man, there have been several other individuals who have taken on the mantle and responsibilities of the iconic superhero:</p>
            <div class="parent2">
                <div class="text"> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Miles Morales:</strong> Created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, Miles Morales first appeared in Ultimate Fallout #4 in 2011. He is a teenager who gains similar powers to Peter Parker after being bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider. Miles becomes Spider-Man in an alternate universe known as the Ultimate Universe and later joins the main Marvel Comics universe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ben Reilly:</strong> Introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #149 in 1975, Ben Reilly is a clone of Peter Parker created by the villainous Jackal. Initially known as the Scarlet Spider, Ben takes on the identity of Spider-Man when Peter briefly retires. He later adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider once again.</li>
                        <li><strong>Miguel O'Hara:</strong> In the year 2099, geneticist Miguel O'Hara gains spider-like abilities through a genetic experiment. He becomes the Spider-Man of the future, protecting the city of Nueva York in a futuristic setting. Miguel O'Hara first appeared in Spider-Man 2099 #1 in 1992.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gwen Stacy (Spider-Gwen/Ghost-Spider):</strong> In an alternate universe where Gwen Stacy is bitten by the radioactive spider instead of Peter Parker, she becomes the superhero known as Spider-Woman or Spider-Gwen. She first appeared in Edge of Spider-Verse #2 in 2014 and gained significant popularity, leading to her own comic book series.</li>

                <h3>Spider-Verse</h3>
                <p>Spider-Verse completely changed the direction of Spider-Man comics forever. Now tied to a larger Web of Life and Destiny, Spider-Man would forever be associated with his variants from different universes. The "Spider-Verse" event would even extend far beyond the pages of Marvel Comics, resulting in the acclaimed Spider-Verse animated film franchise.</p>

                <p>As hated as "One More Day" is, it's essential to understanding Spider-Man's timeline in the Marvel Universe. The storyline features a massive reset for Spider-Man stories, erasing Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson's marriage. "One More Day" leads into the "Brand New Day" initiative, which continued to reinvent Spider-Man's ongoing stories for many more years to come.</p>

                <p>"Kraven's Last Hunt" is essential reading for any Spider-Man fan. Not only does the storyline mark Kraven the Hunter's best appearance in the history of Marvel Comics, but it's widely considered one of Spider-Man's best stories of all time. Far darker than most other Spider-Man comics, "Kraven's Last Hunt" inspired future Spider-Man arcs, including "The Child Within," "The Gauntlet," and "Grim Hunt."</p>

                <h3>Civil War</h3>
                <p>These "Back in Black" storylines were pivotal in Spider-Man's comic book history. In a heavily controversial move, Spider-Man revealed his secret identity to the world during the Civil War storyline, leading to increased threats to his personal life by several supervillains. When the Kingpin had Aunt May shot, however, Spider-Man beat him within an inch of his life in the ever-memorable finale of "Back in Black."

Most notably, the event included the creation of Parker Industries, which would become a focal point for the remainder of Slott's run on The Amazing Spider-Man.</p>

                <p>"Spider-Island" is often forgotten by Spider-Man fans despite its great importance to the character's ongoing stories. Besides being a fun and unique story, "Spider-Island" marks a turning point for Spider-Man as a superhero. After New York gets the chance to walk a mile in his shoes, Spider-Man finds himself much more popular in the public eye, shedding the "menace" label that had plagued him for years.</p>

                <p>Spider-Geddon is the 2018 sequel to the original "Spider-Verse" event. It is one of the biggest multiverse events in Marvel Comics and becomes supremely important in understanding the state of the Spider-Verse. Despite not featuring Peter Parker's Spider-Man in a major role, Spider-Geddon gives Miles Morales his due, allowing him to take leadership over the Spider-Army</p>
