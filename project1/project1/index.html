        <h4>Discover the origins and evolution of Spiderman.</h4>
        <p>Spiderman, also known as Peter Parker, was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko and first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962, published by Marvel Comics.</p>
        <p>Peter Parker was a high school student who gained spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider during a science experiment. He decided to use his newfound powers to fight crime and protect the innocent, becoming the iconic superhero known as Spiderman.</p>
        <p>Throughout the years, Spiderman has faced a variety of villains, including his arch-nemesis the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom, and many others. He has also been a member of superhero teams such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.</p>
        <p>Spiderman's character has undergone various iterations and adaptations in comic books, animated series, movies, and video games, making him one of the most recognizable and beloved superheroes worldwide.</p>
        <h3>Other Spider-Men</h3>
        <p>While Peter Parker is the most well-known Spider-Man, there have been several other individuals who have taken on the mantle and responsibilities of the iconic superhero:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Miles Morales:</strong> Created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, Miles Morales first appeared in Ultimate Fallout #4 in 2011. He is a teenager who gains similar powers to Peter Parker after being bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider. Miles becomes Spider-Man in an alternate universe known as the Ultimate Universe and later joins the main Marvel Comics universe.</li>
            <li><strong>Ben Reilly:</strong> Introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #149 in 1975, Ben Reilly is a clone of Peter Parker created by the villainous Jackal. Initially known as the Scarlet Spider, Ben takes on the identity of Spider-Man when Peter briefly retires. He later adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider once again.</li>
            <li><strong>Miguel O'Hara:</strong> In the year 2099, geneticist Miguel O'Hara gains spider-like abilities through a genetic experiment. He becomes the Spider-Man of the future, protecting the city of Nueva York in a futuristic setting. Miguel O'Hara first appeared in Spider-Man 2099 #1 in 1992.</li>
            <li><strong>Gwen Stacy (Spider-Gwen/Ghost-Spider):</strong> In an alternate universe where Gwen Stacy is bitten by the radioactive spider instead of Peter Parker, she becomes the superhero known as Spider-Woman or Spider-Gwen.

        </ul>
